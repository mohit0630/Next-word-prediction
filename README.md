# next-word-prediction
This project is implemented as part of my learning journey from the Generative AI course by Krish Naik. It demonstrates how to build and deploy deep learning models like LSTM and GRU for Time Series Forecasting.  The entire codebase is recreated from scratch by me while following the tutorials, for hands-on understanding and skill development.
